[![CI](https://github.com/mangrovedao/mangrove/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mangrovedao/mangrove/actions/workflows/node.js.yml) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/mangrovedao/mangrove/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/mangrovedao/mangrove)

This is the Mangrove monorepo which contains most of the packages developed for the Mangrove.

Some other Mangrove packages (like `mangrove-dApp`) live in their own, separate repos. The rules for which packages go where are not hard and fast; On the contrary, we are experimenting with different structures, in order to figure out what the pros and cons are in our specific circumstances.

# Documentation

If you are looking for the Mangrove developer documentation, the main site to go to is [docs.mangrove.exchange](https://docs.mangrove.exchange).

For the Mangrove contracts in `mangrove-solidity`, we extract a doc-site from the rich documentation in the contract files. This is published at [code.mangrove.exchange](https://code.mangrove.exchange).

Each package also contains a README.md with package-specific documentation.

# Prerequisites

For Linux or macOS everything should work out of the box, if you are using Windows, then we recommend installing everything from within WSL2 and expect some quirks.

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14.14+, we recommend installation through [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating), e.g.:

    ```shell
    $ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
    # Reopen shell
    $ nvm install --lts
    ```

2. [Yarn 2](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install), with Node.js >= 16.10:

    ```shell
    $ corepack enable
    ```

3. [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html):

    ```shell
    $ curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    # Reopen shell
    $ foundryup
    ```

4. Clone the git repo with sub-modules

    ```shell
    $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mangrovedao/mangrove.git
    # Or set the global git config once: git config --global submodule.recurse true
    ```

# Usage

The following sections describe the most common use cases in this repo.

## Initial setup

After first cloning the repo, you should run `yarn install` in the root folder.

```shell
$ yarn install
```

Then you need to setup the local environment (still in the root folder) - here we configure all packages identically, but they can also be configured individually:

```shell
$ cp .env.local.example .env.test.local
$ find ./packages/ -name '.env.local.example' | while read line ; do ln -s $(readlink -f ./.env.test.local) $(dirname $line) ; done
```

Then open `.env.test.local` in your favorite editor and put in settings for, e.g., node urls, for instance pointing to [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).

## Build

To build, run

```shell
$ yarn build
```

This can also be done from a specific package in `./packages/<somePackage>` and only builds that package and its dependencies.

If you encounter issues with JavaScript memory consumption, then try increasing the max available space for heap, and try again:

```shell
$ export NODE_OPTIONS="$NODE_OPTIONS --max_old_space_size=4096"
$ yarn build
```

## Test

To run tests, run

```shell
$ yarn test
```

This can also be done from a specific package in `./packages/<somePackage>` to run tests for that specific package.

## Usage details and how to add packages

For more details on how to use Yarn and Yarn workspaces, see the [Yarn 2 CLI documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/install) and for more details on our usage of yarn, see [yarn details](./yarn.md).

# Structure and contents of this monorepo

The repo root contains the following folders and files:

```bash
.
├── .github/         # GitHub related files, in particular CI configurations for GitHub Actions
├── .husky/          # Husky Git hooks, e.g. for auto formatting
├── .yarn/           # Yarn files
├── packages/        # The actual Mangrove packages
├── .gitattributes   # Git attributes for the whole monorepo 
├── .gitignore       # Git ignore for the whole monorepo
├── .yarnrc.yml      # Yarn 2 configuration
├── LICENSES         # Overview of the licenses that apply to this repo
├── README.md        # This README file
├── package.json     # Package file with dependencies and scripts for the monorepo
└── yarn.lock        # Yarn lock file ensuring consistent installs across machines
```

# Git hooks and Husky

We use [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) to manage our Git hooks.

The Git hook scripts are in the `.husky/` folder.

## Husky and Heroku

We currently deploy several off-chain packages to Heroku. To disable Husky from running on a Heroku deploy, we use [pinst](https://github.com/typicode/pinst) package and two heroku-specific `scripts` in the top-level `package.json`:

```json
{
  ... 
    "heroku-postbuild": "pinst --disable && yarn build",
    "heroku-cleanup": "pinst --enable",
  ...
}
```

Note that when Heroku detects a `heroku-postbuild` it [does *not* run the `build` script](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support#customizing-the-build-process), so we need to invoke that specifically.
