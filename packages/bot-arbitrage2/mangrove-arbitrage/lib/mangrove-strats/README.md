# Documentation

If you are looking for the Mangrove developer documentation, the site to go to is [docs.mangrove.exchange](https://docs.mangrove.exchange).

This repository builds on top of [@mangrovedao/mangrove-core](https://github.com/mangrovedao/mangrove-core/). It uses mangrove-core to build a library of strategies that can be used to create offers, execute trades, etc. It also uses mangrove-core's configuration setup for addresses (See mangrove-core's README for more information).
